# Custom Linux kernel for iPad Air 2 (A8X / T7001)
#
# Key differences from standard aarch64 kernel:
# - 16KB pages (Apple SoCs use 16KB, not 4KB)
# - Apple platform drivers (AIC, SPI, watchdog, GPIO)
# - Z2 touch protocol driver (for BCM5976 touch controller)
# - USB gadget networking (primary network interface during bring-up)
# - Simple framebuffer (display initialized by iBoot/pongoOS)
